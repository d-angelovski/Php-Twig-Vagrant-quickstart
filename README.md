## Synopsis

This repo is a simple PHP Twig Bootstrap example, that could be easily boot up with Vagrant on VirtualDisk, and provides sample code for a project. It is good for beginners, since i show how i use PHP, Twig, and Bootstrap, in a project, and how i organize my files (i wrote a tutorial at http://daniel.angelovski.info/php-with-twig-using-vagrant-for-quick-starting-your-projects/). You can also download the source, extract it in folder, and Vagrant up, it would quickly make you a starting point for your next project.

## Motivation

I had spent some time when i transferred from Java to PHP programming, to find the best tools for web development in PHP. This is my tutorial for what i think its best. I haven't used any PHP framework, since i like to create my own logic, and this repo is example, and you can tell me if you like it or not.

## Installation

There is tutorial on http://daniel.angelovski.info/php-with-twig-using-vagrant-for-quick-starting-your-projects/ on how to start the project.
